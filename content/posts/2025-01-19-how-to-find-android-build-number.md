Android build number is a sequence of numbers and characters that identifies the version of your current software. The build number also depicts the details of when the latest code updates were made using a unique identifier.

It is significant for Android developers as it unveils the software version and update details, which plays a crucial role in the update or rollback of firmware, fixation of compatibility issues, and development. Along with that, it plays an important role in the testing, flashing, and rooting processes. 

## General Procedure

Here's a breakdown of how to get Android build number : 

1. Enable USB Debugging on Your Device

    * Locate Developer Options:
        * **Android 10 and later:** **Go to Settings > About phone** and tap on **Build number** seven times. This will enable Developer Options.
        * **Older Android versions:** The path might slightly differ, but generally, it's in **Settings > About phone** or **System**.
    * **Enable Developer Options:** Go to **Settings > System > Developer options**.
    * **Enable USB Debugging:** Toggle the **USB Debugging** switch to the ON position.

2. Authorize Your Computer

    * **Connect your device:** Connect your Android device to your computer using a USB cable.
    * **Accept the authorization request:** On your device, you should see a prompt asking if you want to allow USB debugging from this computer. Tap Allow or Always allow.

3. Verify Connection

    * **Open a terminal or command prompt:**
    * **Run adb devices:** This command checks for connected devices.
        * If successful, you should see your device listed with its ID (e.g., RZ8T81FAYSZ device).
        * If you see unauthorized next to your device ID, repeat steps 1 and 2.

4. Restart (Optional)

    * **Restart your Android device.**
    * **Restart your development environment (IDE).**

If the issue persists:

* **Check your USB cable:** Ensure it's a high-quality cable and properly connected.
* **Try a different USB port:** Some USB ports may not have the necessary drivers or power.
* **Update Android Studio or your development environment:** Make sure you have the latest versions of your development tools.
* **Reinstall Android Studio:** If the problem continues, try reinstalling Android Studio.
